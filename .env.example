# ── Hetzner Cloud (Auto-Provisioning Worker VPSes Only) ──
# Control plane (API, dashboard, DB) stays on your Hostinger VPS. Hetzner is used only to auto-create worker servers when capacity runs low.
# 1. Sign up:   https://console.hetzner.cloud
# 2. Create project (or use default)
# 3. Go to:     Security → API tokens → Generate API token (Read & Write)
HETZNER_API_TOKEN=

# Server type (default: cpx42 = 8 vCPU, 16GB RAM, €19.99/mo — fits ~7 starter users at 2GB each)
# Options: cpx22 (4GB, €6.49), cpx32 (8GB, €10.99), cpx42 (16GB, €19.99), cpx52 (24GB, €28.49)
# HETZNER_SERVER_TYPE=cpx42

# Location (default: nbg1 = Nuremberg, Germany — cheapest)
# Options: nbg1, fsn1, hel1 (EU, cheaper), ash, hil (US), sin (SG)
# HETZNER_LOCATION=nbg1

# Control plane IP. When set: (1) SSH from API to this host uses 127.0.0.1, and (2) this host is
# never used for user containers — only dedicated worker servers (e.g. Hetzner) are used.
# CONTROL_PLANE_IP=your-server-public-ip

# SSH from API server to workers — use one of:
#   SSH_PRIVATE_KEY = base64-encoded private key (base64 -w0 ~/.ssh/openclaw_worker)
#   SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH = path to key file (e.g. /root/.ssh/openclaw_worker) — recommended on server
# SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=
# SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=/root/.ssh/openclaw_worker

# (Optional) SSH public key injected into new workers for API SSH access
# Contents of ~/.ssh/openclaw_worker.pub (starts with "ssh-ed25519 ...")
# WORKER_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY=

# ── Verified skills (control plane) ──
# Path to pre-downloaded, verified skills on the control plane. New users get these by default.
# Populate with: bash scripts/install-skills-from-github.sh
# PLATFORM_SKILLS_DIR=/opt/openclaw-platform/skills

# ── Cloudflare DNS (Auto-creates per-user DNS records pointing to workers) ──
# This lets each user's subdomain resolve directly to the correct worker server.
# Required for multi-worker setups. Without it, DNS must be managed manually.
#
# 1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com → your domain → Overview → right sidebar → "Zone ID"
# 2. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens → Create Token
#    Use template "Edit zone DNS" → select your zone → Create Token
CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=
CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID=

# ── Admin Panel (control plane only) ──
# The admin panel lives on the control plane only. By default the admin API
# accepts requests only from localhost (127.0.0.1, ::1). To use it:
#   1. Set ADMIN_PASSWORD (required). Generate: openssl rand -hex 16
#   2. Grant yourself admin: npm run set-admin -- your@email.com
#   3. Access via SSH port-forward to the control plane, then open dashboard /admin
#      e.g. ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 -L 4000:localhost:4000 user@control-plane
#      Then open http://localhost:3000/admin and log in with your user + admin password.
ADMIN_PASSWORD=generate-a-strong-password-here

# IPs allowed to access the admin panel (comma-separated, no spaces).
# When set, localhost is NOT included — add 127.0.0.1,::1 if you want local access.
# Example: add your office/VPN/home IP so you can open /admin from the dashboard.
ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS=87.94.147.214,213.28.231.105,127.0.0.1,::1

# ── Server Cost Tracking (for admin profit/loss dashboard) ──
